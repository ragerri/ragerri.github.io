I am Ramon y Cajal Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the [IXA Group](http://ixa.eus) and [HiTZ Centre](http://hitz.eus) of the [University of the Basque Country](http://www.ehu.eus). My current interests are focused on NLP problems related to Computational Semantics, and especially on techniques for Information Extraction, Opinion Mining and fake news detection. I am the creator and main developer of [IXA pipes](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes), a set of ready to use of multilingual NLP tools distributed under Apache License 2.0. I am also a Project Management Commitee member and Committer at the [Apache OpenNLP project](http://opennlp.apache.org) of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org).
