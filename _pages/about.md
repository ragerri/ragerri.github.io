I am Ramon y Cajal Research Fellow (tenure-track) at [IXA Group](http://ixa.eus), part of the [HiTZ Centre](http://hitz.eus) of the [University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU](http://www.ehu.eus), where I am head of the [Text Analysis unit](http://www.hitz.eus/en/nlp). I got a PhD in Computer Science at City, University of London (2007), and I have since been working on Natural Language Processing at several British and Spanish institutions, including a two year stint at the industry as research project director. I have been involved as PI or collaborator in more than 40 research projects funded by the European Commission, UK research councils, Spanish Ministry of Science and Basque Goverment and published in the major journals (Artificial Intelligence, etc.) and conferences (ACL, EMNLP, EACL, IJCAI, etc.) related to Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.

Currently my research is focused on Computational Semantics and Information Extraction, with a strong focus on multilingual and cross-lingual approaches. I was the creator and main developer of [IXA pipes](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes), a set of ready to use multilingual tools for linguistic processing. I am also PMC and committer in the [OpenNLP project of the Apache Software Foundation](https://opennlp.apache.org/).

## Final Word

"If it were not for the brute fact that the world contains more than five billion primates that are demonstrably able to produce and comprehend natural languages, mathematical linguists would long ago have been able to present convincing formal demonstrations that such production and comprehension was impossible" (Gerald Gazdar).
