## IXA pipes: Ready to use NLP tools

I am the creator and main developer of [IXA pipes](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes), a modular set of Natural Language Processing tools (or pipes) which provide easy access to NLP technology for several languages. It offers robust and efficient linguistic annotation to both researchers and non-NLP experts with the aim of lowering the barriers of using NLP technology either for research purposes or for small industrial developers and SMEs. The IXA pipes can be used or exploit its modularity to pick and change different components.
