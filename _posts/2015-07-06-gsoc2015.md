## Mentor at Google Summer of Code 2015

I am mentoring in the [Google Summer of Code 2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/) through the [OpenNLP project](http://opennlp.apache.org) of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org). The main objective of [the project](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/mondher/5707702298738688) is to add a new Word Sense Disambiguation component to OpenNLP.
